description: Let $X$ be an infinite set and let $M$ be the monoid with zero given
  by the presentation  $$\langle X\cup X^*\mid x^*y=\delta_{x,y}, x,y\in X\rangle$$
  where $X^*$ is a bijective copy of $X$.  Let $R=K_0M$ be the contracted monoid algebra.  So
  it has $K$-basis $M\setminus \{0\}$ and the product extends that of $M$, where we
  identify the zero of $M$ with the zero of $K$.  Now define $d\colon R\to R$ on the
  basis $M\setminus \{0\}$ as follows.  Fix $x\in X$ and put $$d_x(pq^*) = (|p|_x-|q|_x)pq^*.$$  Here
  $|w|_x$ is the number of occurrences of the letter $x$ in $w$. $d$ is a noninner
  derivation.
