description: The field of rational functions $\mathbb Q(x)$. Also described as the
  quotient field for $\mathbb Q[x]$.  We establish an order on this field by declaring
  a nonzero element $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ to be positive if the leading coefficients
  of $f$ and $g$ have the same sign.  The element $x$ is larger than all of  $\mathbb
  Q$, so that the field is non-Archimedean.
