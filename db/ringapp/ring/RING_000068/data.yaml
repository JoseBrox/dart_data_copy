description: "Let $X$ be a zero-dimensional topological space such that the Stone-\u010C\
  ech compactification $\\beta X$ is not zero-dimensional. The required ring is $R=C(X)$,\
  \ the set of continuous functions from $X$ into $\\mathbb R$.  (A topological space\
  \ is called zero-dimensional if it has a base of clopen sets.)"
