description: Let $G$ be the subgroup of "eventually constant" sequences in $\mathbb
  Z^\mathbb N$ (meaning except for finitely many positions, the positions are equal).
  $G$ is a lattice ordered group with the order $(z_n)\leq (z'_n)$ given by $z_i\leq
  z'_i$ for all $i\in \mathbb N$.  The desired ring is the Jaffard-Ohm-Kaplansky construction
  that yields a Bezout domain with value group $G$.
