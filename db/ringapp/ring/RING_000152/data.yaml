description: The Clifford algebra of a $3$ dimensional $\mathbb R$ vector space with
  bilinear form having signature $(+1,+1,-1)$.  This algebra is isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb
  R)\times M_2(\mathbb R)$. In addition to being viewed as a "geometric algebra" for
  the space, it can also be viewed as the "conformal geometric algebra" for a $1$
  dimensional real vector space.
