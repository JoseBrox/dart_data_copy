description: Enumerate the primes in $\mathbb N$. Let $M$ be the additive submonoid
  of positive rationals generated by $\frac{1}{2^ip_i}$ $i \geq 0$. With a field $k$
  and indeterminate $X$, and generate $k$ algebra generated by $X^m$, $m\in M$. Localize
  at the set of elements with nonzero constant term. This localization is the ring.
