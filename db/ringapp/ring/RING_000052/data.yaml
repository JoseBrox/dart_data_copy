description: Let $F$ be the field of two elements, and consider a countably infinite
  direct sum of copies of $F$. This is a countable boolean ring (without unity). The
  required ring is the subring generated by this subrng of $\prod F$ and the identity
  of $\prod F$. This is still countable.  Alternatively, the ring of "eventually constant"
  sequences in $\prod F$.
