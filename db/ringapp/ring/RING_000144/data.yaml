description: Start with the ring of power series of the form $\sum a_\alpha x^\alpha$
  where $a_\alpha\in \mathbb C$ and $\alpha$ ranges over a well-founded set of nonnegative
  rationals.  Within the field of fractions of this ring, it can be shown there are
  $n$-pairwise independent maximal valuation rings $D_i$. The ring is $R=\cap_{i=1}^n
  D_i$.  For this ring we use $n=2$.
