description: By Krull's theorem for valuation rings, we may take $n>1$ and $G=\mathbb
  Z^n$ with lexicographic order to form a totally ordered Abelian group, and the resulting
  valuation domain $R$ is the ring. In this construction, is is possible to make choices
  to ensure the resulting ring is countable.

notes: The classical Krull dimension of $R$ corresponds to the rank of $G$, in this
  case $n>1$.
