description: '"A module with a projective cover is a B-object (Bass module)"  Over
  $\mathbb Z$, a countable direct sum of copies of $\mathbb Z$ is projective (hence
  has a projective cover) and yet it has quotients (namely $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$
  with no maximal submodules. That is, the kernel of this projection is a proper submodule
  not contained in any maximal submodule.'
