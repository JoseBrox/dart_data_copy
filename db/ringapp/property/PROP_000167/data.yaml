definition: "$R$ is a commutative ring meeting these conditions: 1) $R$ is not local;\
  \ 2) $R$ has a unique minimal prime $P$ which is a nonzero uniserial module; 3)\
  \ $R/P$ is an $h$-local domain; 4)  $R$ is Bezout; 5) The localization $R_M$ is\
  \ an almost maximal valuation ring for every maximal ideal $M$.  (Stronger than\
  \ the definition given by V\xE1mos.)"
