description: Given a monoid with absorbing element $0$ and a ring $S$,  this can be
  thought of as the monoid ring $S[M]$ modulo the ideal generated by $0\in M$.  It
  differs from a monoid ring in that $M\setminus \{0\}$ is a generating set, but it
  is not closed under multiplication.
name: contracted monoid ring
