statement: 'Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring.  Then the proper quotients of
  $R$ are self-injective rings iff $R$ is one of the following types: 1) a Dedekind
  domain; 2) an Artinian principal ideal ring; 3) a local ring with maximal ideal
  $M$ such that $M^2=\{0\}$ and $R$ has composition length $2$.'
