statement: 'If $R$ is a commutative reduced ring, the following are equivalent: 1)
  the classical quotient ring of $R$ is von Neumann regular; 2) The spectrum of minimal
  ideals of $R$ is compact in the Zariski topology, and if a finitely generated ideal
  is contained in a union of minimal primes, it is contained in one of them.'
