statement: The group ring $R[G]$ is right Noetherian IF $R$ is right Noetherian and
  $G$ is finite.  The converse does not hold.  If $R[G]$ is right Noetherian, then
  $R$ is right Noetherian and $G$ has the maximum condition on subgroups.  if $G$
  is additionally abelian, $R[G]$ is right Noetherian iff $R$ is right Noetherian
  and $G$ is finitely generated.
