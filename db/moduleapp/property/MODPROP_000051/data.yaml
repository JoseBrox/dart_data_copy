definition: Given any family of submodules $N_i$ of $M$ indexed by $I$, and elements
  $m_i$ indexed by the same set, if $\cap{i\in F}(m_i+N_i)\neq \emptyset$ for all
  finite subsets of $I$, then $\cap{i\in I}(m_i+N_i)\neq \emptyset$. (In other words,
  every finitely-solvable system of congruence is solvable.)
name: linearly compact
