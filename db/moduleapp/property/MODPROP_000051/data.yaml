definition: Given any family of submodules $N_i$ of $M$ indexed by $I$, and elements
  $m_i$ indexed by the same set, if $\bigcap_{i\in F}(m_i+N_i)\neq \emptyset$ for
  every finite subset $F$ of $I$, then $\bigcap_{i\in I}(m_i+N_i)\neq \emptyset$.
  (In other words, every finitely-solvable system of congruence is solvable.)
name: linearly compact
